# Quick Facebook Chrome Extension

# How to Install
It is not yet on the Chrome Web Store, but I should get round to it soon. So for now, pull down the files, then open up your Chrome Web browser and go to  "chrome://extensions".  Make sure "Developer Mode" box is selected, then select "Load unpacked extension" and job done!  

# How To Use
This is a Chrome Extension I created in order to search Facebook quicker using the Chrome browser.  When in the Chrome URL  search the keyword "face" then select "tab". The user can now search facebook by simply entering in their query to the URL.
